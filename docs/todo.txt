1. Implement the OAuth-like page that takes in user credentials, posts them to identity provider to get access_token.
    - when token is got, post it with the data as shown:  window.parent.postMessage({ type: "authentication", payload: { 'access_token': '<token here>' } }, "*");    
    - other notes: this login page should be a simple extension of our current login page

    - this logic should reside in the includes/class-neexa-ai-api-consumer.php

3. Implement an api consumer that fetches the information about a given ai agent, ie whether data collection feature enable status, crm enable status, channels integration status
    - this logic should reside in the includes/class-neexa-ai-api-consumer.php
