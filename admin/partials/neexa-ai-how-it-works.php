  <h2>🚀 How Neexa Works</h2>

  <h3>Step 1: Create or Log Into Your Neexa AI Account</h3>
  <p>
    To use this plugin, you need a Neexa AI account.
    If you already have one, <a href="https://app.neexa.ai/#login" target="_blank">log in here</a>.
    Otherwise, <a href="https://app.neexa.ai/#signup" target="_blank">sign up for free</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 2: Add Business Information</h3>
  <p>
    Help your AI understand your business by adding details like products, services, FAQs, and more. You can do this in two ways:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Type or paste your content manually (from docs, PDFs, etc).</li>
    <li>Use Neexa’s website scraper — just enter your website URL and Neexa will extract the info.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Step 3: Create Your AI Assistant</h3>
  <p>
    Go to the <a href="https://app.neexa.ai/#widget-chats" target="_blank">Widgets page</a> and click the ➕ button to create a new assistant. 
    You'll set its name, avatar, role, and link it to your business.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 4: Install on Your Website or WhatsApp</h3>
  <p>
    After creating your assistant, click the ✏️ icon (edit) next to it. 
    In the popup, you’ll find the <strong>Installation</strong> tab with your Assistant ID. 
    Copy this ID and paste it into this plugin's settings.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once saved, the assistant will appear on your website or integrate into WhatsApp — ready to chat with your visitors.
